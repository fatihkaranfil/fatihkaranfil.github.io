<h1>About me</h1>

<div>I am a researcher with more than 15 years of experience working on energy economics and policy. I hold a Habilitation to supervise research (HDR) in Economics from the <a href="https://www.parisnanterre.fr/"> University of Paris Nanterre</a>, a Ph.D. in Economics from <a href="https://www.pantheonsorbonne.fr/">University

Since December 2017, I have been a research fellow at <a href="https://kapsarc.org/">KAPSARC</a>, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. I am also research fellow at <a href="https://erf.org.eg/"> Economic Research Fellow (ERF)</a>.

My research focuses mainly on developing economic frameworks to provide insights into energy policymaking in oil-producing countries. My work has been published in general-interest journals (e.g., <i>Applied Economics</i>, <i>Journal of Comparative Economics</i>, <i>Macroeconomic Dynamics</i>), as well as top-tier field journals (e.g., <i>Energy Economics</i>, <i>Energy Journal</i>, <i>Energy Policy</i>).
