<h1>About me</h1>

<div>I am an economist with more than 15 years of experience working on energy economics and policy. I hold a Habilitation to supervise research (HDR) in Economics from the <a href="https://www.parisnanterre.fr/"> University of Paris Nanterre</a>, a Ph.D. in Economics from <a href="https://www.pantheonsorbonne.fr/">University
of Paris 1 Panthéon-Sorbonne</a>, an M.A. in Economic Analysis and Modeling from <a href="https://www.pantheonsorbonne.fr/">University of Paris 1 Panthéon-Sorbonne</a> and <a href="https://www.centralesupelec.fr/">École Centrale Paris</a>, and a B.A. in Economics from <a href="https://www.gsu.edu.tr/">Galatasaray University</a>.
<p> <p>
  
Since December 2017, I have been a research fellow at <a href="https://kapsarc.org/">KAPSARC</a>, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. I am also a research fellow at <a href="https://erf.org.eg/">Economic Research Fellow (ERF)</a>. 
<p> <p>
  
My research focuses mainly on developing economic frameworks to provide insights into energy policymaking in oil-producing countries. My work has been published in general-interest journals (e.g., <i>Applied Economics</i>, <i>Journal of Comparative Economics</i>, <i>Macroeconomic Dynamics</i>), as well as top-tier field journals (e.g., <i>Energy Economics</i>, <i>Energy Journal</i>, <i>Energy Policy</i>).
<p> <p>

Before joining <a href="https://kapsarc.org/">KAPSARC</a>, I worked as an associate professor of economics at the <a href="https://www.parisnanterre.fr/">University of Paris Nanterre</a> and taught courses such as econometrics, energy economics, and environmental economics. During the same period, I was a researcher at <a href="https://economix.fr/">EconomiX-CNRS</a> and worked on projects funded by organizations such as the European Renewable Energy Council and the French Energy Council. Prior to that, I was a researcher at <a href="http://giam.gsu.edu.tr/">Galatasaray University Economic Research Center (GIAM)</a>.
