<h1>About me</h1>

<div>I am currently a research fellow at <a href="https://kapsarc.org/">KAPSARC</a> since December 2017. KAPSARC, located in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, is a non-profit institution for independent research into global energy economics. 
<p> <p>
 
I hold a Habilitation to supervise research (HDR) in Economics from University of Paris Nanterre, a Ph.D. in Economics from University
of Paris 1 Panthéon-Sorbonne, an M.A. in Economic Analysis and Modeling from University of Paris 1 Panthéon-Sorbonne and École Centrale Paris,
and a B.A. in Economics from Galatasaray University.
<p> <p>

I began my career as a researcher at Galatasaray University before moving
to the University of Paris Nanterre where I worked as an associate professor of economics and taught courses econometrics, energy economics, and environmental economics. 
I have also been a researcher at EconomiX-CNRS and an external researcher attached to Galatasaray University Economic Research Center (GIAM). 
<p> <p>   
  
MY current research focuses mainly on developing economic frameworks to provide insights into energy policymaking in oil-producing countries. 
My research has been published in general-interest economics journals (e.g., Applied Economics, Journal of Comparative Economics and Macroeconomic Dynamics), 
as well as journals on energy economics (e.g., Energy Economics, Energy Policy and The Energy Journal).
