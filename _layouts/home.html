<div> Greetings! I am an economist interested in energy and environment. 
<p> <p>  
  
Since December 2017, I have been working at <a href="https://kapsarc.org/">KAPSARC</a> in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, where I currently hold the position of principal fellow. My work focuses on developing economic frameworks to inform environmental and energy policymaking. 
<p> <p>
  
In addition to my research activities, I provide advisory input to Saudi Arabia’s Ministry of Energy, contributing to strategic decision-making and policy formulation in the energy sector. I also served as a T20 task force advisor during the Saudi G20 Presidency in 2020.
<p> <p>
  
Before joining <a href="https://kapsarc.org/">KAPSARC</a>, I held the position of associate professor of economics at the <a href="https://www.parisnanterre.fr/">University of Paris Nanterre</a>, where I taught courses in econometrics, energy economics, and environmental economics. Simultaneously, I conducted research at <a href="https://economix.fr/">EconomiX-CNRS</a>, participating in projects funded by organizations such as the European Renewable Energy Council and the French Energy Council. Earlier in my career, I worked as a researcher at the <a href="http://giam.gsu.edu.tr/">Galatasaray University Economic Research Center (GIAM)</a>.
<p> <p>

I hold a Ph.D. in Economics from the <a href="https://www.pantheonsorbonne.fr/">University of Paris 1 Panthéon-Sorbonne</a> / <a href="https://www.parisschoolofeconomics.eu/">Paris School of Economics</a> and an M.A. in Economic Analysis and Modeling from the <a href="https://www.pantheonsorbonne.fr/">University of Paris 1 Panthéon-Sorbonne</a> and <a href="https://www.centralesupelec.fr/">École Centrale Paris</a>. I also hold an HDR degree, which is a French accreditation to supervise research.
