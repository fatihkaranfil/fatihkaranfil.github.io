### Energy Transition in Oil-Dependent Economies: Public Discount Rates for Investment Project Evaluation

with Axel Pierru  

##### Abstract 

Selecting welfare-enhancing projects necessitates determining the present value of cash flows from a public policy perspective. For an oil-exporting economy, the domestic energy transition often implies displacing oil from domestic consumption. Economic dependence on oil affects the public discount rate for oil price-related cash flows in two opposite ways: On the one hand, it renders the economy more volatile, which lowers the risk-free discount rate; on the other hand, it increases the correlation between consumption and the oil price, which results in a higher risk premium. To study these opposite forces, we first derive the public discount rate for an oil price-related investment project. Our framework considers economic uncertainty, an oil price-related risk premium, and allows for valuing oil at its opportunity cost. We illustrate our methodology using data from a panel of 26 oil-exporting countries. The results indicate that a risk-free discount rate of 3.1% is appropriate for our panel. However, to discount oil price-related cash f lows, a risk premium of 1.4% needs to be added to the risk-free rate, which yields a risk-adjusted real discount rate of 4.5%. We find significant disparities between country-specific public discount rates. Additionally, for each country, we assess the present value of reducing domestic oil consumption by a barrel per day from 2023 to 2040, breaking down the different effects. Oil-exporting countries can use our estimates for making investment or policy decisions.

### Fiscal policy in oil and gas-exporting economies: Good times, bad times and ugly times

with Olivier Durand-Lasserve 

##### Abstract 

We study the cyclicality of fiscal policy to oil and gas revenue in emerging and developing energy-exporting countries. We build a unique oil and gas fiscal revenue database for 30 countries and develop a novel framework to identify various kinds of asymmetry in the response of public expenditure to oil and gas revenue. To explore asymmetries that may occur during revenue cycles, we distinguish between high and low oil and gas revenue regimes, as well as between positive and negative revenue shocks. Using an unbalanced panel over the period 2000–2020, we find that fiscal policy is procyclical in general but neutral when confronted with high but declining revenue, possibly influenced by policymakers' optimistic view that revenue will quickly recover. Moreover, we find the greatest level of procyclicality when revenue is low but increasing. This situation may follow periods of fiscal tightening where governments face greater social pressure to catch up with higher spending. Our results also suggest that financial openness increases procyclicality in low revenue regimes only, and that during these periods, IMF programs are associated with expenditure reductions regardless of improvements or deteriorations of oil and gas revenue.

### The energy transition and export diversification in oil-dependent countries: The role of structural factors

with Luc Désiré Omgba

##### Abstract 

The energy transition toward decarbonization is expected to impact producers of fossil fuels. However, oil-exporting countries are currently key players in the modern economy. Thus, the energy transition will not be successful if state revenues in these countries are not stably maintained. These countries can protect themselves against revenue volatility and mitigate carbon risk by diversifying their economies. However, export diversification appears to be particularly challenging for many oil-producing countries. It is natural to ask why some oil-exporting countries have managed to diversify their economies whereas others have not. We hypothesize that the differences in oil producers' diversification patterns may be associated with differences in their structural characteristics. Such differences may cause countries' diversification trends to diverge. To investigate this hypothesis, we examine whether all countries converge toward the same diversification level. We also check whether their diversification efforts diverge overall but create separate convergence clubs. The results show that structural and institutional factors play a central role in the diversification process. In particular, countries with higher quality infrastructure, human capital and research and development efforts are more likely to converge toward high diversification. Thus, these factors provide greater economic stability in turbulent times and promote a successful energy transition.
