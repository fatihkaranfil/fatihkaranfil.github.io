The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has posed major challenges to healthcare systems worldwide. It will also have long-lasting effects on the economy, pushing millions around the world into precarity and poverty. The already vulnerable will be hit even harder—the slum dwellers; irregular and undocumented migrants, who are mostly women; and low-skilled migrant workers engaged in the informal sector.

Policy action supporting the workers and enterprises operating in both the formal and informal economy is critical in the recovery phase.
