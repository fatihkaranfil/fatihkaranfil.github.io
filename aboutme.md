I have been a research fellow at KAPSARC since December 2017. I began my career as a researcher at Galatasaray University before moving
to the University of Paris Nanterre where I worked as an associate professor of economics. I have also been a researcher at EconomiX-CNRS
and an external researcher attached to Galatasaray University Economic Research Center (GIAM).

I hold a Habilitation to supervise research (HDR) in Economics from University of Paris Nanterre, a Ph.D. in Economics from University
of Paris 1 Panthéon-Sorbonne, an M.A. in Economic Analysis and Modeling from University of Paris 1 Panthéon-Sorbonne and École Centrale Paris,
and a B.A. in Economics from Galatasaray University.
